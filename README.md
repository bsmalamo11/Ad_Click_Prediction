# Ad Click Prediction Model  

## Overview  
This project predicts whether a user will click on an advertisement using machine learning techniques. By analyzing user behavior and ad features, the model helps optimize advertising strategies, improving engagement and click-through rates.  

---

## Problem Statement  
Advertising platforms struggle to maximize campaign effectiveness due to limited insights into user behavior. Predicting ad clicks enables better targeting, reducing costs and improving user engagement. This project leverages machine learning to identify patterns and key factors that influence ad clicks.

## Challenges Faced  
1. **Data Imbalance:**  
   - The dataset had a significant imbalance between click and no-click instances.  
   - **Solution:** Applied the ADASYN oversampling technique to balance the dataset.  

2. **Feature Representation:**  
   - Managing categorical features like device type and ad position was complex.  
   - **Solution:** Used one-hot encoding to ensure proper representation of categorical data.  

3. **Hyperparameter Optimization:**  
   - Tuning model parameters for optimal performance required extensive experimentation.  
   - **Solution:** Used GridSearchCV to automate and optimize parameter selection.

## Dataset  
The dataset includes:  
- **Numerical Features:** Age, time spent on the platform, etc.  
- **Categorical Features:** Gender, device type, ad position, etc.

## Project Workflow  
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
   - Analyzed numerical and categorical data using histograms and pie charts.  
   - Identified trends, such as time-of-day activity spikes.  

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Handled missing values (e.g., replaced categorical NaNs with "Unknown").  
   - Dropped irrelevant columns and created new features like `User Type` (First-Time vs. Recurring Users).  

3. **Model Training:**  
   - Used XGBoost Classifier for its efficiency with large datasets.  
   - Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.  

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Measured performance using precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.  

5. **Deployment:**  
   - Saved the final model using Joblib for future use in production.

## Key Insights  
- **Age:** Certain age groups are more likely to click ads.  
- **Ad Position:** Placement of ads significantly impacts click-through rates.  
- **Time of Day:** User activity varies, with peaks during specific hours.

## Results  
The model achieved high accuracy and interpretability, providing actionable insights for targeted advertising strategies.

## Future Work  
- Enhance feature engineering by including additional behavioral data.  
- Enable real-time predictions by integrating the model into a live application.  
- Experiment with other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
