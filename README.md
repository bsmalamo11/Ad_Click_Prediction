Ad Click Prediction Model
Overview
This project aims to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement using machine learning. By analyzing user behavior and ad features, the model helps optimize advertising strategies, improving engagement and click-through rates.

Problem Statement
Advertising platforms face challenges in maximizing the effectiveness of their campaigns due to limited insights into user behavior. Predicting ad clicks can enhance targeting strategies, reducing costs and improving user engagement. This project addresses this issue by leveraging machine learning to identify patterns and key factors influencing user clicks.

Challenges Faced
Data Imbalance: The dataset had a significant imbalance between click and no-click instances, making it challenging to train a model that performs well across both classes.
Solution: Applied the ADASYN oversampling technique to balance the dataset.
Feature Representation: Managing categorical features like device type and ad position was complex.
Solution: Used one-hot encoding to ensure proper representation of categorical data.
Hyperparameter Optimization: Tuning the model parameters to achieve optimal performance required extensive experimentation.
Solution: Utilized GridSearchCV to automate and optimize parameter selection.
Dataset
The dataset contains the following types of information:

Numerical Features: Age, time spent on the platform, etc.
Categorical Features: Gender, device type, ad position, etc.
Project Workflow
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed numerical and categorical distributions using histograms and pie charts.
Identified trends and patterns, such as time-of-day activity spikes.
Data Preprocessing:
Handled missing values (e.g., imputation and replacing categorical NaNs with "Unknown").
Dropped unnecessary columns to streamline the dataset.
Engineered features like User Type (First-Time vs. Recurring Users).
Model Training:
Used XGBoost Classifier for its efficiency and accuracy in handling large datasets.
Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
Evaluation:
Analyzed performance metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Deployment:
Saved the final model using Joblib for future use in production.
Key Insights
The model identified critical factors influencing ad clicks, such as:

Age: Certain age groups are more likely to click ads.
Ad Position: The placement of ads significantly impacts click-through rates.
Time of Day: User activity varies, with peaks during specific hours.
Results
The model achieved high accuracy and interpretability, enabling actionable insights for targeted advertising strategies.

Future Work
Further feature engineering to include additional behavioral data.
Real-time predictions by integrating the model into a live application.
Testing with different machine learning algorithms for comparison.
Technologies Used
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Model Deployment: Joblib
